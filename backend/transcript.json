            "user_answer": "n Excel, formulas are user-defined expressions that perform calculations, while functions are pre-defined, built-in formulas that perform specific tasks. Formulas combine operators, cell references, and constants, while functions have a defined syntax and perform calculations based on their arguments. ",
